# HONEYMOON!

## Sunrise at Haleakala
You can watch the sun rise at the peak of Haleakala Volcano in Maui. You have to leave the hotel by around 4am in order to catch it. Alarm set for 3:30am. We wake up. We waffle for 20 minutes. We finally get up at 3:50am, and leave by 4 just barely in time to catch the sunrise. No regrets - it was so nice!

## Old Lahaina Luau
Going to a luau seems to be one of those quintessential things to do in Hawaii. The Old Lahaina Luau is reputed to be the best one on the island. So we called for reservations. They said they were full up until after we were gone, but we could go on a waiting list. So wait list we did. They called back the next day to say they had room for any day of the week. Weird. Anyway, the Luau was good. They are famous for their banana bread, which was amaaaazing! Thanks Linda and Paul! (who purchased this for us on the Honeymoon Registry)

## Malasadas
Malasadas are portuguese donuts. They can readily be found in Hawaii, but not so much in Vancouver. Malasadas were first introduced to me by my cousin Janey, who recommended Leonard's bakery on Oahu. Since we were in Hawaii, I had to get another fix. They are yummy!

## Kahului Bay
I spent a lot of time on Yelp this trip, studying up on the tastiest restaurants on Maui. Baguette Bistro was Andy's find, a French bistro which ironically has two locations - Burnaby (on Hastings Street) and Maui. They are known for their French Toast. It was so-o-o good! Now, we have to visit the on in Burnaby. After breakfast, off to yet another beach near the centre of the island, Kahului Bay.

## Kihei Beach
Our average day in Maui involved waking up real late, eating lunch (like I said, realll late) and then heading to the beach.  On day one, before we fell into our lazy-bum schedule, we actually managed to make it out for breakfast.
